Question 1: Can algorithms like SMOTE/ROSE which synthesize new examples from the training data be called Generative AI?

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and ROSE (Random Over-Sampling Examples)  are generative techniques that create synthetic data points to address class imbalance in datasets, but they aren't typically considered Generative AI.
Generative AI learns complex data distributions to generate realistic new data. 
The scope and complexity of Generative AI are broader, spanning applications from image synthesis to text generation.
Thus, while SMOTE and ROSE generate data, they are simpler and more focused on preprocessing for classification tasks.
